# Real Time Fall Detection System
 Developed a real-time video-based fall detection system using YOLO v11, fine-tuned on a subset of the LE2I Fall Detection Dataset. This project leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to accurately detect falls among elderly and mobility-impaired individuals, providing timely alerts with annotated video predictions and archiving model weights for future deployment.
